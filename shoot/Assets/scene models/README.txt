Hello everyone,

Thank you for watching the Tutorials!
Here is everything you are going to need
to follow the Tutorials =)

The Textures in the Folder "Ceiling", "Floor", "Tiles", "Wall"
are not created by me. They where created by a guy on YouTube.
(https://www.youtube.com/user/Nobiax). All of his textures are free to use
and royalty free.

The SoundFX are all taken from YouTubes Audio Libary. Again, all of these sounds
are free to use and royalty free.

The Key model was made by me and is also free to use
(Its butt ugly and was made in <5min so why would you use it? xD)

I hope you enjoy and learn something new.
